###Edison Setup

##Install ubilinux for Edison

Little bit about the Intel Edison: The Intel® Edison is an ultra small computing platform that will change the way you look at embedded electronics. Each Edison is packed with a huge amount of tech goodies into a tiny package while still providing the same robust strength of your go-to single board computer. Powered by the Intel® Atom™ SoC dual-core CPU and including an integrated WiFi, Bluetooth LE, and a 70-pin connector to attach a veritable slew of shield-like “Blocks” which can be stacked on top of each other. It’s no wonder how this little guy is lowering the barrier of entry on the world of electronics!

When getting your Edison, you will want to flash the Edison with the latest image.

ubilinux™ is an embedded linux distro based on Debian "Wheezy." Visit the [ubilinux site](http://www.emutexlabs.com/ubilinux) and follow the [Installation instructions](http://www.emutexlabs.com/ubilinux/29-ubilinux/218-ubilinux-installation-instructions-for-intel-edison)
